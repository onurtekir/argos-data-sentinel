## 🛡️ Overview
**Argos Data Sentinel** is a modern, intelligent monitoring and observability platform inspired by **Argos Panoptes**, the mythological all-seeing guardian with one hundred eyes. Just like Argos, this system continuously watches over your data pipelines, ensuring transparency, reliability, and security.

> **Mission:** Provide real-time data integrity, anomaly detection, and monitoring for distributed systems.

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Real-time data pipeline monitoring
- 🔄 Automated anomaly detection
- 📊 Visual dashboard for data observability
- ⚙️ Integrates with modern data stacks (Python, Airflow, BigQuery, etc.)
- 🚨 Alerts and notifications for abnormal behavior
- 🧠 Adaptive learning for improved alert accuracy

## 🎯 Motivation
In modern data systems, reliability is everything. Data breaks silently. Pipelines fail without warning. Argos Data Sentinel acts as your **all-seeing guardian**, watching every stage and ensuring trust in your data operations.

## 🧱 Architecture (Concept)
```
Data Sources -> Processing Pipelines -> Argos Sentinel -> Alerting & Dashboard
```

## 🚧 Roadmap
